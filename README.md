## OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER



##Personal Thoughts of Ingo Forrer

Through all these weeks in which I have worked with Julian and Ali in order to complete this amazing project combining Laravel, Sass, PHPMyAdmin, and more, I was able to learn and reinforce the usage of different tools to complete the design of this fantastic website.

*Usage of Octopus and FIGMA (Ingo Forrer)

This time I was able to learn more about introducing the very first ideas of a web project with the usage of a new online tool, the one I am speaking about is Octopus. This special online tool gave us the chance to create a special sitemap for us to respect the structure and continue building the website with FIGMA, in which we are not only enhancing visually the first designs but also building components for us to use afterward in every slide or section of the whole project.

*Usage of CSS and SASS (Ingo Forrer)

At the moment of building the skeleton or structure of our website with Julians Help, I was able to understand the proper usage of SASS and how to build and define SASS valuables that afterward would be used instead of rewriting CSS code over and over again. Making the process of styling our website much easier and faster. However, mixing SASS and CSS in Laravel is something I must practice to be more efficient at the moment in designing a project.

*Usage of Laravel and PhpMyAdmin (Ingo Forrer)

I have to be honest, in this specific point, the clear webmaster was our beloved friend Julian, the one who was able to better understand and resolve better all the obstacles encountered at the moment of using PHP and Laravel in order to connect our database and displaying the information contained in our database on the screen. Of course, as partners, we also studied and tried to help our friends as much as we could. I personally feel really happy that despite not being able to properly understand the usage of Laravel and PhpmyAdmin, we were able to help Julian with some specific things throughout this specific process.

##Personal Thoughts Julian Petrini Jäggli

Steps
It was an amazing experience. I think it was the first experience that before going to the code we had the time to think about the idea, the structure, and the design. Later we also learn a little bit more about Figma and how to create components such as the identity of the buttons. The next step was converting Figma into code. In this step, we learned about Sass variables that were surprisingly helpful and also the @extend to make the code lighter in terms of lines. 
Once we finished the mobile-first design, we preferred to continue with the logic and leave to the end the Desktop layout organization (coming soon).
On this fabulous journey, we stepped into many challenges or maybe better said, many opportunities to learn. We were able to import a table database converted from an xlsx file, calling sass styles from names of the database and the chance to commit, merge and control the versions.

Workflow
As it was a pair coding experience(even though we are three in the group :) ) we thought the efficient way was to work on one machine and at the end of each day pull the latest version of the master even though we were sharing screen through discord so we all were following each step. 

##Personal Thoughts -Gisèle Aline Filliol

First of all, I want to emphasize that having worked with Julian and Ingo was a very fruitful and positive experience. 
For me, it was a good learning environment because we were able to understand, ask questions and get answers to all our doubts instead of demanding changes in the code.
We went through many challenges throughout the project's days but fortunately some we managed to figure out the solution, and others we asked for help.
I came to join the group when the Figma layout was already made and I was amazed that the project matches exactly the Figma layout.
I often say that we were in a problem-solving state of mind, trying to search for answers every time.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
